Welcome to our documentation for the free, open-source tool known as GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)! 

This project aims to provide comprehensive, user-friendly documentation for GIMP. Our goal is to help users of all levels understand and effectively use GIMP's wide range of tools and features. 

> ${\color{red}\text{Important Note: This documentation is not exhaustive.}}$  
> *There might be more ways to use these tools that we describe, and there are more tools than we provide documentation for. Feel free to experiment with GIMP to see what it can do for you beyond what we've described.*

## Quickstart

This guide provides quickstart instructions for getting started with GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

### Windows

1. Visit the [GIMP Downloads page](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) and download the installer for Windows.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install GIMP.
3. Once the installation is complete, you can launch GIMP from the Start menu.

### Mac

1. Visit the [GIMP Downloads page](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) and download the appropriate DMG package for your Mac's processor.
2. Open the DMG package and drag the GIMP icon to your Applications folder to install GIMP.
3. Once the installation is complete, you can launch GIMP from your Applications folder.

### Linux

1. GIMP can be installed from the terminal in most Linux distributions. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install GIMP with the following command: 
   > `sudo apt-get install gimp`
2. Once the installation is complete, you can launch GIMP from your applications menu or from the terminal by typing `gimp`.

Check out the [official GIMP documentation](https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/) for more detailed instructions and tutorials.

## Project Structure

The documentation is divided into several sections, each focusing on a different category of tools available in GIMP. These categories include:

- [Selection Tools](Selection%20Tools)
- [Paint Tools](Paint%20Tools)
- [Transform Tools](Transform%20Tools)
- [Color Tools](Color%20Tools)

Each section provides a brief overview of the tools in its category, along with step-by-step instructions on how to use them.


## Audience

Our primary audience for this documentation are beginners and intermediate users of GIMP who are looking to understand and utilize the various tools available in the software. This audience is appropriate as they are the ones who would benefit the most from detailed, step-by-step instructions and explanations of the software's features. To cater to this audience, we have focused on clear, concise language and included plenty of examples and screenshots.

While working on this project, we realized that the audience was specifically people who couldn't understand how to use GIMP, rather than beginners or those who needed a reference. That is, it's likely that this document will never be used as a reference by anyone except us (because we're the ones who made it). Like, there's no way that anyone is going to use our documentation as a reference for how to install GIMP. As such, we decided to keep the Quickstart short and sweet by directing users toward the GIMP downloads page. Isn't that clever?

## Content

In putting together this documentation, we conducted extensive research on GIMP's official documentation, user forums, and tutorials. We also used the software extensively to understand its features and functionalities. The content is meant to facilitate GIMP's usage and encourage users to explore and experiment with GIMP's tools beyond our descriptions. We included information on how to use each tool, tips for effective usage, and troubleshooting advice. We chose to include this information to provide a comprehensive guide for users to refer to when using GIMP.

While working on the project, some of us thought about how making this documentation feature-oriented instead of task-oriented kind of defeated the purpose of the documentation. GIMP already has amazing feature-oriented documentation that we could never hope to surpass, but GIMP's seriously lacking in the task-oriented tasks. For instance, in the [FuzzySelectTool](Selection%20Tools/FuzzySelectTool.md), there is a very small section dedicated to making an image's background transparent. I think if we could do it over again, we might lean towards making it task-oriented to provide a better user experience.

## Appearance

When we started this project, we chose to use HTML and JavaScript to get buttons working. We thought it would provide a nice balance of ease of development and ease of use. However, we *quickly* switched to Markdown because it would simplify a lot of the work we'd need to regarding getting a website working (no hooking up buttons, no hosting the website, etc...). Not to mention how Markdown is easy to write and read, and it can be converted to many output formats like HTML and PDF. We also used plenty of headings and subheadings to make the document easy to navigate. Code blocks and images were used to illustrate points and provide visual aid.

If we could do it over, we would add more to our style guide. For instance, our style guide states that screenshots can vary in size. As such, there are numerous times where we have side-by-side screenshots that do not line up, which is pretty embarrassing considering our documentation is regarding **image manipulation software**. Additionally, our style guide had a few items that were too general to be professional. For instance, our style guide describes how there should be "some indication to direct user attention, like a red box or arrow". Because of this, there is a variety of indicators to direct user attention across the documentation, as each person chose a different thing to do. 

## Experience

Not only was this a valuable experience on how to use GIMP, but it was also valuable regarding group work. We all made small communication errors that we started to learn from, and by the end, things were running quite smoothly. Plus, it doesn't hurt that experimenting with GIMP was actually kind of fun! Hopefully, it will be of use to some poor chap who's just trying to edit their photo.

In retrospect, we would probably try to condense visual aids like screenshots and diagrams in the next iteration to make the instructions even clearer. That is, it was often simplest to load up our documentation on as many screenshots as possible so as to ensure that the user best understood what was going on. However, this occasionally created problems in comprehension because the users had to scroll up and down to compare relevant images.
